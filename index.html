                                        <h3>Open House: October 30th</h3>
                                        <p>It's that glorious time of year again. The colors of the city are a little brighter and the air is a little more crisp. That's right, it's Chicago Artists Month. Every year the Fire Arts Center likes to invite you in for an open house to give you a chance to see what we are all about.</p>

                                    <p>Here's our schedule for the day so don't miss out:</p>

                                        <p style="margin-left:45px;"><strong>11am - 2pm</strong>: Figure sculpture demo open studio open<br>

                                        <h3>Payment Plans and Discounts</h3>
                                        <p>We at the Fire Arts Center of Chicago are not immune to the challenges of a difficult economy. Our mission has always been to preserve the traditional methods and techniques of sculptors as well as the technical skills relevant to those just looking to develop a new trade. In order for us to meet that mission we need to provide our classes to as many people as we can. However, when times are tough, finding the money to pay for classes like this is hard. For that reason we have been offering a 1/2-down payment plan to make it easier to pay for classes. Now, in addition to that discount, we are introducing a bartered services option to reduce class prices.</p>
                                        <h4>How does it work?</h4>
                                        <p>Do you have experience with fund-raising and think you can lend a hand? Maybe accounting or legal experience? Do you work somewhere that tosses out scrap metal which could be reused by us? The possibilties are endless. The Fire Arts Center is always looking for tips and materials to help us grow, and we want to offer you ways to learn for less.</p>
                                        <h4>How do I take advantage of the payment plans and discounts?</h4>
                                        <p>Call us at 773.544.9908. It's as simple as that. Call and let us know what you have to trade and we can work out a discount plan for you.</p>

                                        <p>As always our class registration is rolling which means you can join at any time. The classes are small and the instructors help you work at your pace. So no matter when you start you will be walked step-by-step through the process with the personal attention you need. Join when you want and stay for as long as you need.</p>
