                                        <p>The purpose of the Fire Arts Center of Chicago School of Sculpture is to preserve and promote traditional sculpture technique. To achieve this goal, we offer high quality sculpture training.</p>
                                        <p>Technical knowledge and the language of aesthetics has always defined the narrative of art. Thus, a grounding in both of these areas gives each artist the tools to progress their ideas to unmapped areas of meaning. The fine arts have always had a positive synergistic relationship with business, philosophy and science. Our educational program reinforces this view by encouraging technical proficiency and scientific understanding, as well as conceptual and marketing skills at all levels.</p>
